## What is it?
This is contribuition to the orginal repo , fixing  : 
1- make it upload excel files only 
2- deploy the app to heruko  : https://formanalyser.herokuapp.com/
3- style >> mahmoud 
4- add custom chart type >>> Noura 
5- refactor the code 





I faced a situation where i had a google form with too many responses and some of the responses are random and needed some cleaning.  When you make your updates and back to the charts you'll realize that they are still the same! so the original form charts do not update after your edits.

### But
you can download the data and upload it to this website and it will plot all the charts for you!

## Getting started
only two step:
1. Download your Spreadsheet/Excel
2. [upload it to this website](https://nizaralsaeed.github.io/formsAnalyser/)

# Why's? 
1. Style is simple.
2. Any file type can be uploaded 
3. Only one type of chart was used.
4. Code is a bit complicated. 
5. Need to be deployed.
